## 🚀 About Me
**10-year Army veteran** turned software developer — I swore I'd never work that hard again, and then I discovered production bugs at 2 AM.  

I'm a backend-heavy developer who loves building **scalable systems** with **Ruby on Rails**, experimenting with **Prisma + Next.js**, and making databases actually perform like they're supposed to. Lately, I've been diving deep into **C# .NET** and building some tools that I'm not quite ready to talk about yet (but trust me, they're cool).  

I've got a mix of professional experience leading engineering teams and personal projects where I get to explore ideas from scratch — because sometimes you just need to build something your way.  

---

### 🔧 What I’ve Been Up To

#### **Loghatch (Personal Project)**
I built **Loghatch** because I got tired of existing tools not doing what I actually needed for biological research logging. Whether you're tracking ants, insects, or your neighbor's suspiciously large garden gnome collection — this thing's got you covered.  
It's not just another iNaturalist clone — it's flexible, personal, and actually built for people who want control:  

- Custom logbooks & templates that fit *your* research style  
- Timeline view for tracking entries over time  
- Collaboration: invite contributors, comment, and build logbooks together  
- Privacy control: public or private logs  
- Tags, media, and rich fields so you capture all the details  

**Why Prisma?**  
This project gave me the excuse to really dive into **Prisma**, and honestly, I'm a convert. I use it to:  
- Define and evolve schemas without wanting to flip a table  
- Keep complex queries readable and type-safe in **TypeScript** (future me says thanks)  
- Batch queries and avoid those sneaky N+1 issues that love to hide in GraphQL APIs  
- Experiment with performance optimizations on **PostgreSQL** and actually see results  

The stack: **Next.js + Prisma + Node.js + PostgreSQL**.  

---

#### **Professional Work**
- At **The Veteran Lending Team (Founding Engineer)**, I guide six dev teams, set up security + dev standards, and try to keep our Rails + Next.js stack from catching fire as we scale. So far, so good.  
- At **Apple Fritter Technologies**, I lead client projects — designing systems, mentoring devs, and delivering custom Rails/React/GraphQL apps that actually do what they're supposed to.  
- Previously at **Southern States Toyotalift**, I optimized large Rails apps, slashed query times, and helped keep enterprise-scale dealer systems running smoothly (and quickly).  

---

### 🛠️ My Current Toolbox
**Rails, Prisma, Next.js, PostgreSQL, GraphQL, RSpec, Node.js, Docker, AWS, C# .NET**  

---

### 🌟 Sometimes I Play With
**Go, Nginx, jQuery, Python, gRPC** (and whatever else seems interesting at 11 PM)  

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I spent 10 years in the Army as a Wheeled Vehicle Technician 🚛, which taught me two things: how to troubleshoot anything under pressure, and that systems thinking applies to way more than just engines. Also, debugging code is infinitely better than rebuilding transmissions in the Georgia heat.  

---

If you're curious about **Loghatch**, check it out — it's still early, but it's the project I'm most excited about.  
Otherwise, you'll probably find me deep in Rails engines, wrestling with Prisma queries, or learning C# at unreasonable hours because apparently I enjoy suffering.
